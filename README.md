# Advanced Search Engine and Recommendation System

This project focuses on developing a robust **Advanced Search Engine** and **Personalized Recommendation System** for e-commerce platforms. With the ever-increasing volume of online products, our solution enhances the user experience by delivering highly relevant search results and tailored product recommendations based on individual preferences.

### Key Features:
- **Advanced Search Engine:** Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, and deep learning models like Sentence-BERT to improve the accuracy of product search results.
- **Content-Based Recommendation System:** Leverages user data, including browsing behavior and purchase history, to provide personalized product recommendations.
- **Multilingual Support:** The system is designed to handle queries in multiple languages, expanding its usability across global markets.

### Technologies Used:
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Sentence-BERT for semantic understanding.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models like BERT for enhanced recommendation accuracy.
- **NLP Techniques:** Tokenization, word embeddings, and semantic sentence embedding for better query understanding.

### Results:
- Significant improvement in the relevance of search results and personalized recommendations.
- Enhanced user satisfaction and increased customer engagement on e-commerce platforms.
